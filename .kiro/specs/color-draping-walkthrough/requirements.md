# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a beautiful, smooth walkthrough UI for users' color analysis results that simulates a real professional color draping session. Users have already uploaded their photo and received analysis output from the model including their color season, best colors with HEX values, colors to avoid with HEX values, and feedback for each color. The walkthrough will present this existing data in an immersive, step-by-step experience where users see their photo with realistic fabric swatches under their chin, just like a professional stylist would do in person.
